# I, Napoleon

This isn't a review, or a post about my thoughts on the game. It's more a players guide. Something that's digital, mobile friendly, and a shortcut to many of the things I consistently look up in the official rulebook.

## Sequence of Play

This is a semi-detailed Sequence of Play that covers just enough to avoid referencing the rulebook.

### Year Setup Phase
This phase is skipped in the first year of any scenario.

1. Advance the Year marker
2. Reset the Card Draw marker
3. Take income

    1. May exchange **Political** for **Administrative** `1:1`
    2. May exchange **Glory** for **Administrative** `3:1`

!!! note ""

    Either Resource conversion may only yield up to a maximum combined total of 3 Admin points per year.

### Card Deck Phase
This phase is skipped in the first year of any scenario.

1. Remove Cards

    !!! note ""

        Years when cards are removed:  
        1794, 1795, 1796, 1802, 1803, 1813, 1814, 1815, 1816

2. Add Cards
3. Shuffle Draw Deck

!!! bug ""

    The game ends If

    - Brumaire (47) has not been played by the end of CMD
    - or if Imperial Plebiscite (110) has not been played by the end of FCD.

### Card Action Phase

### Campaign Resolution Phase

### Diplomatic Phase

### Domestic Politics Phase

### Clean-Up Phase
