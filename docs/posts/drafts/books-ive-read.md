# Books I've read

The Lord of the Rings
 - Needs no introduction. But if you're a fan of the books, and the films... then I submit to you, a fantastic series of long-form blog posts from Dr. Bret Deveraux on his site [A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry](https://acoup.blog)

    - [Helms Deep](https://acoup.blog/2020/05/01/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-i-bargaining-for-goods-at-helms-gate/)
    - [The Siege of Gondor](https://acoup.blog/2019/05/10/collections-the-siege-of-gondor/)
