# My Plans for the 2024 Solar Eclipse
This post is mostly a collection of my notes from [here](https://github.com/tlofreso/2024-total-solar-eclipse){target=_blank} with a little more context throughout.  

If you haven't heard, there's going to be a [Total Solar Eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/){target=_blank} across North America on April 8th [GetÂ Hyped!](https://youtu.be/AwlGxVcVNNw?feature=shared){target=_blank} ðŸŒ‘

<!-- more -->

I live near Cleveland, smack dab in the middle of totality. (yay!) There are many parks, and a massive lake to view the Eclipse from. There are also groups putting on events like the [Great Lakes Science Center](https://greatscience.com/explore/events-programs/total-eclipse-fest-2024){target=_blank}, and the [Cuyahoga Astronomical Association](https://cuyastro.org/the-total-solar-eclipse-of-2024/){target=_blank}.

> CAA members will bring telescopes, including solar telescopes.

What a generous gesture!

## Gear for Eclipse Day

### Glasses
You must have glasses that are `ISO 12312-2` certified. Buy them now, the price won't go down. Here are two options:  

 - [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N9T9CZL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1){target=_blank} are the ones I bought
 - [these](https://www.eclipseglasses.com/collections/eclipse-glasses-stock?sca_ref=2753051.yTIACw5DUs){target=_blank} by American Paper Optics

### Apps
There are two apps available for free, with an in-app purchase for a guided tour / push notifications for the 2024 eclipse.

 - [Solar Eclipse Timer](https://www.solareclipsetimer.com){target=_blank} is the defacto standard for Solar Eclipse Apps.

## Locations

Ohio likely has the most people in totality outside of Texas.

 - If you're in Youngstown, drive 5 miles North
 - If you're in Canton, drive 5 miles North
 - If you're in Columbus, drive 10 miles North
 - If you're in Cincinnati, drive 15 miles North
