# People I Follow
This list ended up being way longer than I anticipated. If I wrote about someone here, there's a good chance I've sponsored them in some way. Via Patreon, or buying merch, or books they've authored, etc... I would advocate that you do the same for interesting people that in some way, provide value to you. <!-- more --> All are simply ordered alphabetically.

## Bert Hubert
I came across Bert's site via a post to Hackernews that linked to this article: [Reverse Engineering the source code of the BioNTech/Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/){:target="blank"}. Nowhere have I found a more concise and compelling depiction of how mRNA can be used to help humans fight pathogens. In '22, he wrote a fascinating little tool that beeps everytime google tracks you ([demo here](https://x.com/bert_hu_bert/status/1561466204602220544?s=20){:target="blank"}). More recently, he's spent time deep diving on [climate change](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/co2-global-warming-sensitivity){:target="blank"}.

??? note "Topics Bert covers"

    Bert's topics are so broad, it's difficult for me to articulate in a bulleted list. But I've followed him for:

     - mRNA Education
     - Climate Science
     - General Technology

## Corey Schafer
Credited by much of the community with the best free Python tutorials available. Corey is very good at introducing a topic, then showing you a more elegant / advanced way to do the same thing. If you want to get started with web development, Corey's courses on [Flask](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH){:target="blank"} or [Django](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p){:target="blank"} are top notch. I also highly recommend his videos covering VS Code ([win](https://youtu.be/-nh9rCzPJ20?feature=shared){:target="blank"}/[mac](https://youtu.be/06I63_p-2A4?feature=shared){:target="blank"}).

## Jeff Geerling
A tech generalist who regularly couples his educational videos with written blog posts (super helpful). He's authored a number of [books](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/books){:target="blank"}, contributes to several open source projects, and is exteremely transparent about the challenges he's had with Crohn's... often raising money and advocating for folks going through similar struggles. He also does videos with his dad over at [Geerling Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/@GeerlingEngineering){:target="blank"}, a channel that covers awesome Radio stuff.

## Scott Manley
A dev for Apple by trade, but he rarely ever talks about that. No, this Scotsman graces the Internet with an uncanny intellect for Space, Physics, and Flying. He's a go-to resource for summarized space happenings with [Deep Space Updates - Space News](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEnU3ZBhEA7PJUiIhbsSyaLl&feature=shared){:target="blank"}. Scott recently acquired his private pilot certificate, and shared [this](https://x.com/DJSnM/status/1620597123619385344?s=20){:target="blank"} fun post being recognized over radio by a Blackhawk pilot. Lastly, I will never not be jealous of his [Lego livestream builds](https://www.youtube.com/live/xwQBy_rANgI?feature=shared){:target="blank"} where he'll crack open an IPA, build for a few hours, and banter with his followers raking in a few hundred from super chats.

## Simon Sarris
Professionally, Simon builds [GoJS](https://gojs.net/latest/index.html){:target="blank"}, but I follow for all the other things he spends time on. Primarily, the [beautiful home](https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1703208763400822993/photo/1){:target="blank"} he's built, but also, various [writings](https://map.simonsarris.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=substack_profile){:target="blank"} and side projects:

## Tall Paul Tech
An unapologetically brash Austrailian who knows a ton about RF & networking. Paul spends his time mounting Discone antennas, doing deep dives on packet captures, and occasionally plays music / cooks. If you're in networking, [this playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGvkW0sr-RWYdqxQEx3aCx4cxZP7DvSur&feature=shared){:target="blank"} is a __must__. If you happen to live around Brisbane, he does do an annual meetup... Otherwise, you can find him on IRC.

## Tim Urban
The mind behind [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com){:target="blank"}. Long form blog posts that take really complex topics and break them down into bits anyone can understand. Check [this](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html){:target="blank"} one out all about the brain, or [this](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/03/energy-dummies.html){:target="blank"} one about energy production. He also recently authored a [book](https://waitbutwhy.com/whatsourproblem){:target="blank"}.
